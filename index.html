	<h2>Hey! Hi! Hello! I'm Sil</h2> <!-- My government name is Silifat-->
	<h3> Welcome to my Page! </h3>
<div>
	<p>My name is Silifat but i like to be called Sil. I was born in Nigeria and raised New York. I attended SUNY Farmingdale for my undergrad and graduated with a B.S in Business Managment. I've worked as a retail manager for the last 7 years with Saks Fifth Avenue, Ralph Lauren and Victoria Secret. I enjoyed my time in retail and im excited to start this new adventure. Looking forward to learning everything about software engineering and starting a new carrer that might allow me to have holidays off. I look forward to getting to know everyone and helping each other out to accomplish our software engineering goals. Before i go i must say, i love to enjoy my life to the fullest! I love everything that involves me having a good time, my hobby is having a good time. I love eating, travelling and shopping.</p>
